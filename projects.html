        <h2>Project 1 - Peer Mentor</h2>
        <p>
          I was working as a Peer Mentor of First-Year students in college. It
          was a great experience to become a student leader that help new
          college students get familiar with Babson College. Through this
          experience, I see the importance of role of Peer Mentor because we can
          use our own college experience and life experience to advice new
          students how to become successful and at the same time have a great
          college life!

        <h2>Project 2 - Babson Dance Ensemble</h2>
        <p>
          In Babson College, I am part of Babson Dance Ensemble. We will operate
          a dance show around the end of every semester. I'm having a very fun
          time when dancing. Also, I was able to learn different types of dances
          such as grooving hiphop and contemporary.Here are some pictures of the
          show I participated.

        <h2>Project 3 - Travelling</h2>
        <p>
          Within college years, I have travelled to different countries and
          explored many different cultures and landscapes. FOr example, Korea,
          Bahamas, and Italy. Those travelling experiences offered me a broader
          view of the world. Here are some pictures I took during trips.
